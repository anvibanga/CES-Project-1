Creative Embedded Systems: Project 1

My first assignment for Creative Embedded Systems was to create a piece of generative art that runs on the ESP32 TTGO T-Display.
I chose to display the lyrics to Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire."

I rotated the color of the text between red, orange, and yellow, because those are the colors typically associated with fire.
I chose a black background to make sure the colors popped. Most of the lyrics appear in random locations on the screen, 
making sure that they really jump out at the viewer just like they would in the actual song. 
However, the chorus remains in the same spot every time, to convey the reliability of the chorus in the song.

I soldered the JST connector to the battery and then connected them to the ESP32. After charging the battery, I flashed the code
onto the ESP32.

After uploading the program, we had to create the contraption to hang our ESP32s from the ceiling in the Milstein Center. 
We did so by fashioning a hanging box out thick paper, string, and a popsicle stick. 
It was a little tricky to make sure the ESP32 remained in the correct position in the box, but a little bit of double-sided tape did the trick.
